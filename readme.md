# KWin Script returnToTile
When using the new Tiles feature in KDE (Super+t), maximizing and subsequently unmaximizing a tiled window does not return the window to its previously asssigned tile. This Script "fixes" the issue (apparently it's intended behaviour). 

# Version 1.1
Adds Shortcuts to quickly assign windows to a tile, as well as shortcuts to navigate between tiles.

# Important Issues
Does not work on multi monitor setups and is a little buggy on Wayland.

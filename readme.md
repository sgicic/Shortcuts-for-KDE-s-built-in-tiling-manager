#KWin Script returnToTile
When using the new Tiles feature in KDE (Super+t), maximizing and subsequently unmaximizing a tiled window does not return the window to its previously asssigned tile. This Script "fixes" the issue (apparently it's intended behaviour). 

#Important Issues
Does not work on multi monitor setups.
